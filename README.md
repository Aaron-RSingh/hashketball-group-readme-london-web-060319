# hashketball-group-readme

## Overview

1. With your table - walk through your solutions to hashketball! 

## Instructions

### Step 1: One person from your table should put their code for hashketball onto the monitor

The point of this exercise is to help eachothers understanding of the lab, and more importantly hashes. If you feel that your overall solution is not the best, or you had a hard time with some of the tests, then it is in your best interest to volunteer to monitor your code. It will allow the table to help with those issues and, chances are, someone else at your table has the same issues.

### Step 2: Your table should take turns walking through each test

When it is your turn to walk through the code you'll have two options:

1. You can talk through the monitored solution for the test you are on

How do we talk through a solution? Well, start by describing it line by line. What is being sent into the method? How is that being changed or altered on each line? What does a particular line return? Under what circumstances would that line be invoked? What do you expect will be the final return of the method?

2. You can attempt to solve the test from scratch while someone else codes your solution

Try solving the test without refering to your original solution. The code on the monitor should be commented out and pushed out of sight. If this is the approach you would like to take then see step 5 on how to go about pair programming.

Note: Whoever goes first should talk through the `#game_hash` test. After that the next person to go should try pair programming for the `#num_points_scored` test. You can choose to talk through the code when it is your turn to go, but it is encouraged to pair program.

### Step 3: After each method have a discussion amongst your table 

If you had a different solution or approach to solving this particular test you should share your code.

A nice way to approach this:
- Identify lines of code that differ from your own
- Ask the person who solved that code why they choose to solve it that way
- Share your code and why you solved it that way
- Ask for feedback

### Step 4: IMPORTANT: Do not rush!

Take the time to ask and answer questions. A BIG skill in coding is having the ability to fully understand and assess a question. Many times coders are plagued by gaps of knowledge they didn't know they had. The best way to keep yourself honest is to constantly ask and answer any question possible!

### Step 5: If you finish early and have yet to complete the bonus and Super bonus questions - Pair Program

Your table should work together toward solving them. If you have already solved the bonus questions, but your table-mates have not - take it upon yourself to drive for the group coding. If no one has solved the bonus questions then pick someone from your table (who was not already monitoring their code) to drive for the experience while the rest of the table acts as the lead.

#### How to Drive:

Hook your computer up to the monitor, comment out your bonus and super bonus answers (if you had already solved them) and help the table get to the solution. Your goal is not to solve these problems for them, but to transcribe their ideas into code. When given a problem you should use what you think is the best option to solve it. Feel free to google and use online resources, but try to solve the issue presented before asking your table. 

#### How to Lead:

Your focus is on the big picture - how to get to the solution. You will be leading the driver by giving instruction as if you were testing the code. For example: "I want this method to iterate through each element of a hash and return all of the keys into a new array." It is then up the driver to determain what the best approach to solve this would be (maybe they use a loop, .map, .each...). If they get stuck then you may point them in the right direction to help get them jump started, like: "check out the .keys method." Last, if their solution is a different approach from you might have taken, that is alright, do not dismiss it. Follow their train of thought (or ask them for it if you're unclear) and continue to work off that solution instead of refactoring their code (I guarentee someone will learn something new with this approach... it might even be you!).

### Step 6: Have Fun!

This will be one of your first experiences with analyzing code with a group in the programming field. It is not meant to be easy, but it is a skill that you will need in the future.
